## Chaya Stern, Course Director
Chaya is a TPCB graduate student in the Chodera lab working on computational 
molecular models used in drug discovery. The NumFocus education initiative and 
this course was born out of the memory of her frustration trying to fill the
gaps in software development and methodology early on in graduate school. 
Her hope is that courses like this will make it easier for scientists 
to implement good software practices.

## Daniel Smith, Clean code and Documentation
Daniel is a Software Scientist at the Molecular Sciences Software Institute, 
a nexus for science, education, and cooperation serving the worldwide community 
of computational molecular scientists. He traditionally writes software for 
open-source, high-performance quantum chemistry, but has recently begun to 
develop community-scale quantum chemistry databases for machine learning, 
biomolecular forcefield fitting, and novel method accuracy assessment.

## Christopher J. Wright, Package Management
Christopher grew up in Rockville Centre, New York. He attended Brown 
University where he earned a BS with honors in Chemical Physics. He worked 
with Prof. Shouheng Sun on electrochemical CO2 reduction and the structural 
dynamics of nanoparticles. After working at Brookhaven National Laboratory 
as a summer intern, he attended the University of South Carolina, working 
with Prof. Xiao-Dong Zhou on the atomic structure of solid oxide fuel cell 
components and earned a masters in Chemical Engineering. He joined the Billinge
Group in 2016 and is currently working on analysis pipelines, data processing 
techniques and simulation software for PDF. Christopher is also a core developer 
for the conda-forge packaging ecosystem, president of Columbia qSTEM and sits on 
the Columbia Foundations for Research Computing advisory board. In his free time 
Christopher develops for open source projects, plays woodwind instruments, enjoys 
good scotch and works out by playing squash.

## Jane Adams, Testing
Jane Adams is a Data Scientist at Two Sigma Investments where she leads 
data quality strategy for Data Engineering, and she is the co -creator 
and -maintainer of [marbles](https://github.com/twosigma/marbles), an open-source Python testing library that 
gives your tests beautiful failure messages. She holds an undergraduate 
degree from NYU in Complex Systems, and a masters degree from NYU in 
Urban Data Science. Throughout her career, she has worked on both data 
science and engineering teams, and is always looking for new ways to 
share skills (or steal ideas) and improve communication across disciplines. 
She has traveled around the world to talk about topics ranging from how 
ants find your picnic basket to how to not accidentally hurt people with 
data. You can watch her talk about unit testing data at PyData Amsterdam [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enlNiRSt9nk)
