Many STEM undergraduate degrees do not require their students to take computer science courses. While this might 
have been a reasonable decision decades ago, current technology and the amount of data most scientists deal with 
require better training in software development and methodology. This course will provide scientists with the right 
tools to implement software best-practices in their work. During the sessions, you will learn about concepts such 
as version control, testing, documentation, packaging and sharing code. The goal is not only to introduce these 
concepts, but also provide enough practical training for attendees to start using it in their work.

### Who is this course for?
MSK scientists (grad students to faculty) who have some coding familiarity; 
you must know about for and while loops and might have written some scripts to analyze data.
