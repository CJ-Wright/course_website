### Note to instructors:
* To add materials, fork this repo and checkout the `gh-pages` branch.  
* Add a markdown document in the [`_posts`](https://github.com/ChayaSt/course_website/tree/gh-pages/_posts) folder.  
* The name of the file should follow the format `year-month-day-title.markdown`. 
* Add preperation instructions and links to materials in that file.  
* If you want to add materials directly to this repo instead of linking to it, create a new folder under `_posts` and link to it in your 
`year-month-day-title.markdown` file.  
* Open a PR to `gh-pages`
